# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

### VSCode Docker Extension
Docker for VSCode makes it easy to work with Docker

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview

Gitpod is preinstalled with theis extension -> in my case I did not see it, so I added it using the extensions tab. 

### Containerize Backend
Run in the terminal: 

    cd backend-flask
    export FRONTEND_URL="*"
    export BACKEND_URL="*"
    python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
    cd ..
    
* remember to install requirements.txt -> pip3 install -r requirements.txt   
* make sure to unlock the port on the port tab
* open the link for 4567 in your browser
* append to the url to /api/activities/home

I get back a json:

### Add Dockerfile
Create a file here: backend-flask/Dockerfile

    FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

    WORKDIR /backend-flask

    COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
    RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    COPY . .

    ENV FLASK_ENV=development

    EXPOSE ${PORT}
    CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
    
### Build Container

    docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask

This line creates a docker image from the dockerfile, but we still need to start the container (aka run it)

### Run Container

There are several options to pass the env variables, I used this: 

    docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask

Here I am running the backend application as a container in the background so that I can use my termal to print the running containers:

I see as images the basic slim-buster image that is used as a based as well as the one I created for my backend container:

I can also see data being returned as json if I go to the URL in ports (make sure is unlocked!)

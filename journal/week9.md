# Week 9 â€” CI/CD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy

This week, I had a great time learning about AWS code build and code pipeline services with the Cruddur backend. I want to give a big shoutout to "jamesoundb" and "anle4s" - two awesome bootcampers who helped me out with some issues I was having, one with the log groups and the other with the missing permissions in a video. Proof of my work can be seen in the journal. 

However, I have to say that since week 5 of the bootcamp, it's been a real challenge keeping up with the workload, even when just completing the checklist items. It's been taking me around 10-12 hours per week, and it's been tough to maintain that level of commitment even though I really enjoy the material.

So, I was thrilled to finally have a bit of a break with week 9 (CI/CD), which required less than four hours of video. It's also been really fun getting to know some of the other bootcampers - the crew (as can be seen on Discord) really got much smaller in the last 2-3 weeks. Thanks again for organizing this.

This policy statement was missing (thanks anle4s!) 

      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
              "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
              "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
              "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
              "ecr:PutImage",
              "ecr:UploadLayerPart",
              "ecr:BatchGetImage",
              "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
          }
        ]
      }
      

Very important to check this box!! otherwise the build will fail:

### Install AWS CLI in gitpod 

    tasks:
      - name: aws-cli
        env:
          AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
        init: |
          cd /workspace
          curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
          unzip awscliv2.zip
          sudo ./aws/install
          cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
      
Also instead of exporting the AWS credentials as [usual](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html), gitpod has as [special syntax](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables) to persist them. 

### Create Budgets with AWS Cli

        aws budgets create-budget --account-id $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID --budget file://aws/json/budget.json --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/notifications-with-subscribers.json
        
I see the budget on my AWS account. Remember to delete it to avoid costs.

### Create Billing Alarm with Cloudwatch

I followed this [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html) in AWS docs.

For that I also needed to create an SNS topic and subscribe to it which I did with the cli.

### Support Case with AWS 

At first I tried to use my personal email address to setup the bootcamp. It was an old AWS that was un-activated. I had a lot of problems due to my account not being fully activated. After trying for two days scalating the case within AWS support, I decided to re-do the setup with my LSE account. 010116213471
I wish I had done this earlier as I got really frustrated with week 0 due to this issue (I thought I was already dropping out!!) Glad I found a solution and I can continue to week1.
